During my first semester in university, I learned about different networks and I was very intrigued in the way centralized networks are taking control over people's lives. So I decided to use this project as a critique to centralized networks such as Meta and X. With the "model of Centralized network" coming out of Elon Musk's mouth, I am insinuating that all the doom-scrolling, likes, comments, and other activities are feeding right into comapnies and their CEO's, we're exchanging the present for the shallowness of media behind the screens.


 With Tom's help I was able to create a centralized network that explodes and shows up whenever the page is clicked. Since I want to make the centralized network pop out of Elon Musk's mouth I personally drew a cartoon version of Elon and made it a PNG and attempted to allign it with the cetral node. I struggled multiple times when trying to add this PNG as it would often interrupt the whole code page, and I would have to go over it all again. I also found a tutorial (linked below) explaining that I had to do a "function preload" of the image for it to show up on the page, which allowed me to accomplish my desired product. In addition, I used the help of P5 Js's reference page as I wanted to add personalized notes my codes, this way, I can show my teacher my personal understandings and help myself in this process of learning how variables function.
