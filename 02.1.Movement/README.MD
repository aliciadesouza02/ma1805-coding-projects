Since this task asks us to consider how coded movement might suggest cultural and environmental dynamics, I decided to use the reference website (p5 js) to my advantage and find a coding that could embed to my message of global warming.

Here's my Harvard referenced website:
    P5js.org. (2025). #78 - Fire Particles by Allayna -p5.js Web Editor. [online] Available at: https://editor.p5js.org/Allayna/sketches/o239lOcns [Accessed 4 Nov. 2025].
