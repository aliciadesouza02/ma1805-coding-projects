Since this task asks us to consider how coded movement might suggest cultural and environmental dynamics, I decided to use the reference website (p5 js) to my advantage and find a coding that could add to my message. Rather than creating an artwork where people can interact with their screens, I created a piece that incorporates simple movements that we see throughout the night at the beach (cars passing by, sometimes a fire, and the waves). My original intention was to make the waves move as well but I found it difficult to use so many variables without interfering with each other's code. I also played around with the RGB colors for a night look of the beach. The fire particles were actually from a code that I found in the p5Js website, however, while adjusting it to my liking I started to understand what some of the functions are for.

Here's my Harvard referenced website:

The following link was used to understand what 'class' was for

I used a Youtube video tutorial to understand how the variables work for the car. Here's the Haravard citation:
