For this activity, I used Tom's video tutorial to do the sentence word by word. Since the assessment brief asked us to explore how patterns, series, and variations echo mass culture, protest, work... I wanted to create a meaningful piece. My original thought was to use mixed media and create a BLM piece, having the "I have a dream" speech appear word by word. However, I noticed that I had to put every single word in quotations and commas which isn't very time effective. So I opted for the Apollo 11 landing, which was revolutionary and also very important for science and mankind.
